As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is important to be aware of who holds power and influence over the technology we use every day. This is especially true when it comes to the internet, which has become a vital part of our daily lives. Unfortunately, some of the most popular websites and platforms are owned or partially owned by organisations and companys which are almost completly controlled by the the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

The CCP's track record on human rights, religious freedom, and ideological dogmatism are well documented. The party's extreme control over the lives of its citizens and its leader Xi Jinping's consolidation of power are also causes for concern. In addition, the CCP has pursued a more assertive foreign policy strategy, leading to increased tensions with the United States and its allies.

These policies have had severe consequences for the people of Xinjiang and Tibet, where the CCP has implemented brutal and repressive policies. As a result, it is important to know who owns the websites we use every day and whether they are affiliated with the CCP.

Our website is designed to help you do just that. By simply entering the URL of a website, our tool will search for any CCP-owned shareholders and alert you to potential risks. We believe that knowledge is power, and by being aware of who holds power over the technology we use, we can make more informed decisions about our online activities and protect our digital privacy and security.
